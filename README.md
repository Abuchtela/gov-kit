# GovKit
GovKit is a react toolkit for creating and parsing Bravo Governor flavored proposal transactions (target, value, calldata). It is unopinionated about styling, and offers forms for creating proposals in human readable form (i.e. without having to manually create calldata) as well as utils and components for parsing and displaying raw proposal data in human readable form.

### Getting started
See `src/App.tsx` for a demo example.

### Thanks
This work would not be possible without the foundation build by the team at Camp.
